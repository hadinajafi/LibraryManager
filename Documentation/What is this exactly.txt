-What is this exactly for?
An important question in begining of every project.
This project aims to solve our problem with managing documents, files, texts for now. (I'll make it for other file types later).

-How is managing concept for this project?
Ok, as I know, there is no tool in system filemanagers to tag a file or categorize it. so I decided to make a tool that plays that role. Tagging and Categorizing is the concept. Tags can easily managed, and are more findable. Categories is another concept for making the files easily sorted.

-example:
1. we have multiple Word docs, we have also PDFs, and also some PowerPoint files. so we make a category for our educational files, another for programming stuff, another for work. this is Category concept here.
2. we have above files, now we can add #java tag to the java docs, for example files for how to code or programming solutions. and also these files maybe are in two or more categories; we don't care. the important part is we can easily find any file tagged with #java. we can see what is about java between our huge file container.

This Project's aim is not only a library manager for only docs. you will be able to manage your photos, videos. tag them and find them only with simple clicks, not going thru a lot of folders to find a beautiful wallpaper or find a last year pictures with friends.
No need to search and expend a lot of time.

-What's awesome?
I'll make it automized, I mean it is pain in butt to tag and categorize every file in your PC or Disk. so what's the solution? I think for now the only solution is processing the files we have, for example if a file contains Java in its name or content, so it can have a #Java tag. but it needs processing and it's not my proirity for now, but maybe I work on it later.
